# BSAD_384_EcommerceClothingRetailerSystem

This project is an emulation of the creation of a proposed solution to the information management needs 
of a online clothing retailer - particularly as it relates to the customer facing side - sales, reviews, 
and order fufillment; how they would manage data, what data is important, as well as a peak at what metrics 
they might consider important.

Information management of this nature is crucial to organizations and stakeholders; information helps 
us to understand the company, be it for the purpose of strategic decision making, investing, or deliberation between
projects - relevant, quality information, is nessesairy. 

Data for this project was created at random. See the 'pre-prossesing' directory. Note that this data is not
