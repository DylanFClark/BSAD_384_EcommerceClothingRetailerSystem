This project is an emulation of the creation of a online clothing retailer - particularly 
as it relates to the customer facing side - sales, reviews, and order fufillment; how they 
would manage data, what data is important, as well as a peak at what metrics they might consider important.

Information management of this nature is crucial to organizations and stakeholders; information helps 
us to understand the company, be it for the purpose of strategic decision making, investing, or deliberation between
projects - relevant, quality information, is nessesairy. 

Data for this project was created at random. See the 'pre-prossesing' directory. Note that this data is not 
representative of any real entity and created purely to populate this database.
